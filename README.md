# CSS-Platform
My platform for CSS first year representative for the 2019-2020 term.

Hi everyone, I’m Jeremie and I’m running for first year rep for CSS.

Now that we’re all finished with that dreaded COMP 1000 exam, I can talk to you guys a little about what my aim is for CSS.

My platform is 3-fold, and includes:

1. Connecting first year students together so we can help each other in classes
2. Connect first years with the resources they need to be successful not only in class, but also in hard and soft skill development
3. Represent and be a voice for all students to help YOUR voices and ideas be heard. (Let’s face it, with how many of us there are, we can all make the CS department better if we all work together)

Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you can relate to some of what I hope to achieve, a vote for me is greatly appreciated!
